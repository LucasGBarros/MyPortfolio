            <p class="about__me">My name is Lucas Gomes de Barros, and I'm 24 years old. <strong class="contrast">My
                    journey with technology began when I first got my hands on a PlayStation 1 console, which sparked my
                    passion for all things tech.</strong> Over the years, as technology evolved, I delved deeper into
                its intricacies, particularly in the realm of bug discovery and troubleshooting.</p>
            <p class="about__me">My first encounter with bugs came while playing the renowned game "GRAND THEFT AUTO:
                San Andreas". Through navigating the game's storyline, I began noticing glitches that could either
                enhance or hinder gameplay. <strong class="contrast">This discovery fueled my fascination with bug
                    finding, eventually leading me to realize the existence of a specialized field for bug hunting and
                    correction during my college years.</strong></p>
            <p class="about__me"><strong class="contrast">Through diligent study and dedication, I secured a position in
                    the QA field, where I applied my skills to identify bugs in banking applications and resolve issues
                    within the financial market.</strong> I spent 1 year and 8 months working in this capacity before
                transitioning to a new challenge a 3-month stint in an artificial intelligence project focused on
                industrial monitoring.</p>
            <p class="about__me"><strong class="contrast">Currently, I reside in Ireland as part of an exchange program
                    aimed at refining my English language and speaking skills.</strong> Additionally, I'm studying
                Spanish to broaden my linguistic abilities.</p>
            <p class="about__me">I'm deeply passionate about exploring diverse cultures, meeting new people, and
                maintaining a curious mindset. This drive keeps me constantly evolving and focused on pursuing my goals
                and beliefs.</p>
